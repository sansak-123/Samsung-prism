All settings: `configs/config.yaml`. Every stage is resumable (re-running skips finished work).

---

## [0] Configuration - `configs/config.yaml`, `prism/common.py`
- `project_seed: 2026` drives every random choice (documents, severities, splits, subsets).
- Paths are resolved relative to the project root; `abspath()` normalises Windows `\` so metadata
  generated on Windows works on Linux (Kaggle/Colab).

## [1] Dataset: the "24 generation" ladder - `scripts/01_generate_dataset.py`, `prism/ladder.py`
Per Original `i` (300 Originals = 13 per template, multiprocessing pool): `control_0` + **6 edit families x
4 levels = 24 releases**, each changing ONE thing (one multi-line text block) - the prism_iqa "24 generation"
(github.com/Sanjana432/prism_iqa `LADDERS`). `ladder.knobs` selects the families; 7 more exist (11 of the
12 metrics then get their own ladder, 52 releases per Original).

1. **Document** - `prism/templates.py`, `document.py`, `objects.py`: one of the 23 templates (`dataset.templates`),
   seeded text, prices, names, colours, 11 bundled font families, paper texture, logos, stamps, QR codes,
   signatures, photos. A multi-line body block is chosen that no edit can push into other content.
2. **Edits** - each release re-renders the Original with one local change; pixels outside the edited block
   are audited to be unchanged.
Every score is computed automatically while the image is generated (no manual annotation), from what was
actually drawn, on the physical scales in `metrics.PHYS`.
`score = round(1 - min(1, severity), 2)`.

| Edit family | Levels | Metric | Severity (written out in each release's `score_calculation`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| font_family (nominal) | same class / other class / monospace (or another cross-class face if it does not fit) / other class bold | font_similarity (+ semantic_emphasis for bold) | 0.4 x typeface term (0.5 same class, 1.0 other class) + 0.2 x bold |
| font_size | x1.01, 1.025, 1.05, 1.10 (line pitch kept) | font_similarity | 0.6 x abs(drawn size ratio - 1) / 0.35 |
| font_color | +2, 5, 10, 20 grey levels towards lower contrast | font_similarity | 0.6 x min(1, dE2000(ink) / 25) |
| inpaint_color_mismatch | 1, 3, 6, 12 grey levels on the re-filled patch | background_fidelity | dE2000(patch mean) / 25 |
| justification | block shifted 1, 2, 4, 8 px | alignment_preservation | px / hypot(40, 12) |
| line_spacing | +1, 2, 4, 8 px per line | reading_flow | (px / line pitch) / 0.6 |
| char_substitution | 1, 2, 3, 5 characters -> look-alikes (0/O, 1/l, rn/m ...) | ocr_accuracy | (substituted / characters in block) / 0.25 |
| ghost_residue | old glyphs at 2, 5, 10, 20 % opacity, 2 px offset | ghost_text_residue | opacity / 0.45 |
| texture_smoothing | 5, 10, 20, 35 % of the paper grain blurred away in the patch | texture_continuity | measured 1 - std(detail after) / std(detail before) |
| lighting_drop | soft shadow 2, 4, 8, 15 % darker at its centre, fading to 0 at the edges | lighting_consistency | drop / 0.45 |
| local_compression | block area re-saved as JPEG q92, 88, 82, 72 | authenticity | (95 - q) / 75 |
| object_shift | one logo / QR / stamp / photo moved 1, 2, 4, 8 px | object_preservation | px / 30 |
| heading_shift | one title / heading moved 1, 2, 4, 8 px | visual_anchor_integrity | px / 25 |

(semantic_emphasis has no ladder of its own; it moves with the bold font_family level.)

- Targets are chosen so that every edited version stays on the page, inside the panel it sits on
  (bubble / card / label) and clear of every other text block, object and rule; the object / heading must
  be able to move 8 px without touching anything. A document lacking a movable object or heading retries
  with new seeds; if still none, that family is skipped for that Original and recorded in `skipped_knobs`.
- The edited block is drawn **4x supersampled** (8x below 13 px) in the Original, the control and every
  release: Pillow rasterises at whole-pixel sizes, so a 1 % size change only survives supersampled.
- Per release: `render_audit` (changed pixels, pixels changed outside the edited region - always 0),
  `score_calculation` (formula with the measured numbers for all 12 metrics) and `pixel_measurements`
  (12 image-only measurements ported from prism_iqa `vision.compare`: changed-pixel fraction, ink IoU,
  font-height / line-pitch / left-edge deltas, foreground / background RGB distance, ...).
- **Check the scores yourself:** `python scripts/check_ladder_scores.py` re-computes every score from the
  stored measurements with its own copy of the formulas, checks locality, and cross-checks the images
  (controls pixel-identical, a 4 px shift shows up as a 4 px left-edge move, ...) ->
  `reports/ladder_score_check.csv` (one row per release x metric: formula, recomputed, stored).
- **Reasoning target** - `prism/reasoning.py` writes one `observation -> score` line per metric;
  lines name the region (e.g. `in the top-right block "Bill To Karthik ..."`).
- Outputs: `data/images/ladder_XXXX/`, `ladder.jsonl`, `ladder_metadata.csv`, `ladder_summary.json`,
  `metadata_ladder.json` (metadata_real.json schema with measured `metric_scores`, plus trailing
  `score_calculation` and `pixel_measurements`). 300 x 26 = 7,800 PNG.
- Ladder evaluation (part of `06_evaluate.py`): detection rate per level (prediction below the model's
  own control prediction), just-noticeable level (>= 50 % detected), Spearman(level, prediction), false-alarm
  rate on the identical controls, **attribution precision** (share of the predicted drop that lands on the
  edited metric) and the full edit x metric leakage matrix, figure `ladder_sensitivity.png`.

## [2] Leakage-free splits + pairwise records - `scripts/02_build_splits.py`
- Group by `sample_id`, stratify by template, shuffle with the seed: 70 / 15 / 15 ->
  208 / 46 / 46 Originals = **5,200 / 1,150 / 1,150 pairs** (control + 24 releases each).
- One record per (Original, Release): image paths, `prompt_id = P4`, `scores`, and
  `target = "<analysis>\n" + reasoning + "\n</analysis>\n" + JSON(12 scores)`.
- Assertion: every `sample_id` appears in exactly one split -> `split_manifest.json`.
- `splits.holdout_templates`: listed templates go entirely to test -> generalisation to document types
  never seen in training. Data-engine samples (`ladder_engine.jsonl`, stage 12) are added to train only.

## [3] Pilot + self-test (CPU)
- `make_pilot_showcase.py`: 12 metrics × 5 levels (scores 0.95…0.25), one metric changed at a time ->
  `pilot/sheets/`.
- `00_selftest.py`: renderer, gate, score engine and the full evaluation path with mock predictors
  (oracle + N(0, 0.05) must give MAE ≈ 0.04; malformed outputs must be caught).

## [4] Prompt study - `scripts/03_prompt_study_and_baseline.py`, `prism/prompts.py`
Base model untouched (4-bit), on a fixed seeded subset of **validation** (`prompt_study_n`, 30 on T4):
- **P1** minimal instruction + key list -> JSON.
- **P2** per-metric rubric + JSON spec.
- **P3** rubric + "output ONLY one JSON object".
- **P4** rubric + forced CoT: `<analysis>` with exactly one `- <observation> -> <score>` line per metric
  in fixed order, `</analysis>`, then JSON.
- Selection: `min(pooled MAE + 0.5 × (1 − valid_rate))` -> `reports/prompt_study.csv/json`,
  per-metric diagnostics `metric_diagnostics_zero_shot.csv`.

## [5] Zero-shot baseline
Selected prompt on the full **test** split -> `predictions/baseline_zero_shot_test.jsonl`.

## [6] QLoRA fine-tuning - `scripts/04_train_qlora.py`
- **Model**: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`, bitsandbytes **4-bit NF4, double quant**, compute dtype
  bf16 if supported else fp16 (T4 -> fp16); `prepare_model_for_kbit_training`; SDPA attention.
- **Vision input**: dynamic resolution, `min_pixels 200,704` / `max_pixels 501,760` (T4) ->
  256-640 visual tokens per image (one token per 28×28 px). `max_seq_len 4096`, **never truncated**
  (over-length raises an error).
- **Collator**: chat template (system + "ORIGINAL:" img + "RELEASE:" img + P4 + target); labels = −100
  before the `<|im_start|>assistant\n` marker and on padding -> loss only on CoT + JSON.
- **LoRA**: `target_modules = all-linear`, r 16, α 32, dropout 0.05, bias none.
- **Optimisation**: TRL `SFTTrainer` (fallback: `transformers.Trainer`), batch 1 × grad-accum 16,
  LR 1e-4 cosine, warmup 5%, weight decay 0.01, max grad norm 1.0, `paged_adamw_8bit`,
  gradient checkpointing (non-reentrant), epochs 2 on T4 (3 default) = 93 steps/epoch.
- **Checkpoint selection** (`ValGenerationCallback`): every ½ epoch (46 steps) -> eval loss on 120 val
  pairs, then **generation** on a fixed 32-pair val subset -> gate -> MAE;
  `selection = MAE + 0.5 × invalid_rate`; best -> `outputs/best_adapter/` (+ `val_score.json`);
  history -> `outputs/val_generation_log.jsonl`.
- Resumes from `outputs/checkpoints/checkpoint-*` (keeps last 3). Final -> `final_adapter/`, `training_log.json`.

## [7] Fine-tuned inference - `scripts/05_infer.py`, `prism/vlm.py`
- Base 4-bit + `PeftModel(best_adapter)`, greedy decoding, left padding, batch 2 (T4),
  `max_new_tokens 768` for P4 (256 for others); CUDA OOM -> falls back to batch 1 for that batch.
- Appends each row to `predictions/finetuned_qlora_test.jsonl` (resumable).
- Writes `reports/release_report_finetuned_qlora.xlsx` (per sample: 12 scores, categories, overall, rank).

## [8] Validation gate - `prism/validation.py`
1. Take balanced `{…}` spans, last first.
2. Clean: single -> double quotes, drop trailing commas; `json.loads`.
3. Map key aliases (`ocr_accuracy`, `OCR Accuracy`, `ocraccuracy` …) to the 12 canonical keys.
4. Each value numeric and in [0, 1]; all 12 present -> accept; else error codes.
5. On failure: **one retry** with a strict JSON-only prompt (256 tokens); still failing -> invalid, logged.

## [9] Python score engine - `prism/scoring.py`
- category = mean of its 4 metrics; overall = weighted mean of categories (weights 1/1/1).
- ranking: sort by (−overall, −technical, release id); best = first.
- Identical code for ground truth and predictions.

## [10] Evaluation + diagnostic audit - `scripts/06_evaluate.py`, `prism/evaluation.py`, `prism/report.py`
- **Regression** (per metric / category / overall / template): MAE, RMSE, PLCC, SROCC, bias,
  accuracy within ±0.05 / ±0.10 / ±0.15.
- **Bands**: excellent ≥ 0.90, good 0.75-0.90, fair 0.50-0.75, poor < 0.50 -> accuracy + macro-F1.
- **Ranking**: over the 24 edited releases of each Original (control excluded): best-release accuracy,
  exact order, Kendall τ, pairwise preference accuracy.
- **Coverage**: valid-output rate after the gate.
- **Audit**: top errors (|error| > 0.30), failure patterns, error by severity.
- **No manual annotation**: all ground truth comes from the renderer's measurements.
- Outputs: `reports/evaluation_report.md`, `evaluation_metrics.xlsx`, figures, ranking CSVs.

## [11] Judge any image pair - `scripts/07_judge.py`, `prism/judge.py`
`python scripts/07_judge.py --original a.png --release b.png` (or `--pairs pairs.csv`): the fine-tuned model
scores the pair, then deterministic Python returns **ACCEPT / REJECT** (any metric < `evaluation.gate_threshold`),
the failing metrics with the model's own observation (what and where) and a **repair action** per metric
(`prism/judge.py FIXES`). Domain-agnostic: translated or AI-edited documents, re-typeset scans, UI screenshots
across builds/languages, tamper screening. 06_evaluate.py reports the same gate on the test split:
decision accuracy, reject precision/recall, false-reject rate and **diagnosis accuracy** (right metric blamed).

## [12] Self-improving data engine - `scripts/08_data_engine.py`
Reads the ladder analysis of a model, finds the edit families it still misses at level 1, generates new
ladder Originals containing only those families (`data/metadata/ladder_engine.jsonl`) and 02_build_splits.py
adds them to training. Retrain -> re-evaluate -> repeat: each round targets the model's current blind spots.

## Explanation check (in 06_evaluate.py)
For ladder releases the model's analysis line for the edited metric is compared with the ground-truth line:
**location accuracy** (same top/middle/bottom-left/right phrase) and **quantity accuracy** (same px / %
within 25 % or 1 unit). It measures whether the written reason is true, not only whether the score is close.

## Execution (Kaggle, free T4) - `kaggle/`
| Session | Runs | Inputs attached |
|---|---|---|
| `prism-vlm-datagen` (CPU) | stages 1-2 | code dataset |
| `prism-vlm-train` (GPU) | stage 6 | code + datagen output |
| `prism-vlm-baseline` (GPU) | stages 4-5 | code + datagen output |
| `prism-vlm-finish` (GPU) | stages 7-10 | code + datagen + baseline + train outputs |

- One GPU session at a time (free tier); each stage in its own session so memory is not shared.
- T4 overrides: `max_pixels 501760`, `inference.batch_size 2`, `train.epochs 2`, `prompt_study_n 30`.
- Each session stops itself at 10.5 h so its output is always saved; state lives in
  `/kaggle/working/state` and is merged into the next session.
